  <h1>200 Days, 1000 Problems, Whatever Happens Happens</h1>
  
  <p>Look, I'll be straight with you. I'm doing something that's probably stupid: solving 5 LeetCode problems every single day for the next 200 days. That's 1000 problems total, plus learning JavaScript frameworks, plus building projects that don't suck.</p>

  <p>Am I documenting this because I think I'm special? No. Am I doing it for accountability? Maybe. Mostly I'm doing it because I'm curious what happens when you actually stick to something this specific for this long.</p>

  <h2>What's the Deal</h2>
  <div class="highlight">
    <p>The plan is simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>10 LeetCode problems every day (no exceptions, no excuses)</li>
      <li>Get actually good at JavaScript and React ecosystem</li>
      <li>Build some projects that combine my AI background with web dev</li>
      <li>See if I can position myself better than 70% of developers out there</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Why I'm Not Starting From Zero</h2>
  
  <p>I'm not one of those "I learned to code in 3 months" stories. I've already got Python/Flask down, built a few full-stack apps, and I'm studying AI/Data Science. I've even led teams at hackathons and won some stuff.</p>

  <p>But here's the thing — having some skills and being consistently good at problem-solving are different beasts. I can build things, sure. Can I solve any algorithmic problem thrown at me? Can I architect systems that don't fall apart? Can I code in JavaScript without googling basic syntax?</p>

  <p>Honestly? Probably not yet.</p>

  <h2>The Only Non-Negotiable Thing</h2>
  <div class="non-negotiable">
    <p><strong>5 problems a day. Every day. For 200 days.</strong></p>
    <p>5 in the morning before anything else happens. 5 at night before I call it a day. Sick, tired, busy, celebrating, hungover — doesn't matter. This number doesn't change.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Rough Game Plan</h2>

  <p>I'm breaking this into chunks because 200 days feels abstract:</p>

  <div class="phase">
    <h3>Days 1-70: Get the Foundation Right</h3>
    <p>Focus on arrays, strings, basic data structures. Learn TypeScript properly this time. Stop writing JavaScript like it's Python.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="phase">
    <h3>Days 71-140: The Hard Stuff</h3>
    <p>Trees, graphs, dynamic programming. Next.js and system design. Build something that actually integrates AI in a useful way.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="phase">
    <h3>Days 141-200: Polish and Hunt</h3>
    <p>Company-specific problem sets. Advanced algorithms. Portfolio that doesn't look like a tutorial project. Get ready to actually apply places.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>What Makes This Different</h2>
  <p>I'm not trying to become a developer — I already am one. I'm trying to become the kind of developer who can solve problems quickly, build systems that scale, and combine AI with web development in ways that actually matter.</p>

  <p>Also, I'm not pretending this is going to be easy or that I'll stick to every detail of the plan. Things will go wrong. I'll have bad days. Some problems will destroy me. Some projects will fail.</p>

  <p>That's fine. The point isn't perfection — it's consistency.</p>

  <h2>What You'll Get Here</h2>
  <p>I'll probably update this thing regularly with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which problems made me want to quit programming forever</li>
    <li>JavaScript concepts that finally clicked</li>
    <li>Projects that turned out better (or worse) than expected</li>
    <li>The inevitable weeks where everything goes off track</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Real Question</h2>
  <p>Can someone actually do 2000 LeetCode problems in 200 days while learning frameworks and building projects? I don't know. Most people would say it's too much.</p>

  <p>But here's what I do know: I've never really tested my limits. I've never committed to something this specific for this long. I've never had a plan this detailed.</p>

  <p>So we'll see what happens.</p>

  <p>Day 1 starts tomorrow. Either I'll have an interesting story to tell in 200 days, or I'll have learned something about why most people don't finish what they start.</p>

  <p>Both outcomes seem worth finding out.</p>
