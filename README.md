# 🐝 BeeByte

Welcome to **BeeByte** — a living digital notebook where I share thoughts, learnings, and experiments across a variety of interests.  
This isn’t a blog locked into a niche. It’s a space for documenting **curiosity in motion**.

## 🌐 What This Is

A simple blog hosted on GitHub Pages — intentionally minimal, thoughtfully written.

Here, you might find posts about:

- 🧠 Tech and development ideas
- 🧳 Travel reflections
- 🗣 Language learning journeys
- 🔧 Custom dotfiles and setups
- 🧭 Life lessons, mistakes, and mindset shifts
- 🎯 Communication, habits, or anything I’m exploring deeply at the moment

In short: if I’m learning or thinking about something — it may end up here.

## ✍️ Why This Blog?

Because not everything worth sharing fits into a tweet or a tutorial.

I needed a space that grows with me — not one that locks me into a brand, algorithm, or niche.

ByteLog is just that:  
A collection of byte-sized (and not-so-byte-sized) entries chronicling the bytes of my life.
